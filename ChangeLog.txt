	Deleted unnecessary "using" lines
	Added general purpose AYA_ModuleGenericAnimation
		All parameters for ModuleGenericAnimation are valid
		Following new values are used:
			extendAll 		Message to display in PAW when parts are retracted.  Defaults to: "Extend all parts"
			retractAll		Message for when parts are extended/deployed.  Defaults to:  "Retract all parts"
			closedPosition	The animation value for when the parts are closed.  Defaults to 0, 
							if the parts are closed when the animation is run then set this equal to 1


0.11.16.4
	Enabled the following in the editor:
		Solar panels
		ActiveRadiator
		Radiator
		Cargo Bays

0.11.16.2
	Re-enabled the NearFutureSolar, using Reflection instead of direct reference

0.11.16.1
	Disabled the NearFutureSolar to avoid having a direct reference

0.11.16 
	Added NearFutureSolar panels to AYA_Solar
	Added support for multiple ModuleAnimateGeneric and multiple ModuleCargoBay modules
	Added patch for Mark IV Cargo Tail to fix 2 small bugs:
		typo:  sstartEventGUIName
		Wrong value for: closedPosition
	Optimized code so that the PAW menu for parts is only updated when needed (when the mouse 
	goes over the part).  This is a very significant improvement, and is noticable with large 
	vessels which have lots of the following types of parts:
		Cargo bays
		Drills
		Engines
		Fuel Cells
		SaS (reaction wheels)
		Solar

0.11.0
		Recompile for 1.3

0.10.2
		Mod adopted by Linuxgugamer
		Added deploy/retract all for antennae, thank s@verdesmarald

0.10.1
		Bugfix and code optimization, plus some changes to menus
		Updated to 1.2.2
		Fixed: Null Reference errors when deploying/retracting solar panels when static panels were present.
		Buttons are more logical now, "retract all" is available on all extended panels, while "extend all" is on retracted ones. Changes for Radiators, Solar Panels, and Cargo Bays.
		Minor changes: Does not appear on extended solar panels that cannot retract. Cargo Bays can be toggled while in motion to whatever they will eventually be.

0.9
		Broke each type into it's own file
		Fixed AYA_SAS code

0.8: 
		Added functionality to the new 1.2 "Science Box."
		"Perform All Science" even though it's not actually a science experiment, for ease of use.
		"Reset All Science" - the good part.
		Will reset all experiments whose data has not been collected.
		Will reset Mystery Goo and Science Jr (and hopefully any modded science) if you have a scientist on board.
		Usage: Pin the Science Box right-click menu, then click in turn "perform science", "collect data", and "reset science." Repeat in all biomes.

0.7: 
		Recompile for KSP 1.2 (Prerelease, should work in final as well)

0.6: 
		Quick fix for M.O.L.E. parts. They utilize ModuleScienceExperiment but shouldn't be auto-collected. I've hard coded to ignore them when triggering science.

0.5: 
		Bugfix release
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA allowed you to run Mystery Goo and Materials Bay science that had been collected, but not reset.

0.4: 
		Bugfix release
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA allowed you to perform surface samples in a command chair without having to upgrade R&D
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA would only run the first experiment it came across in any given part. Now it will run each experiment in turn for all parts. Note this did affect the stock game, but would affect any modded parts with multiple experiments.
		Included all source files in source zip, to hopefully make it easier for others to build from source.

0.3: 
		Science Experiments confirmed working.

0.2: 
		Radiators confirmed working.

0.1: 
		Solar panels confirmed working.
