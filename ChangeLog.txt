0.10.2
		Mod adopted by Linuxgugamer

0.10.1
		Bugfix and code optimization, plus some changes to menus
		Updated to 1.2.2
		Fixed: Null Reference errors when deploying/retracting solar panels when static panels were present.
		Buttons are more logical now, "retract all" is available on all extended panels, while "extend all" is on retracted ones. Changes for Radiators, Solar Panels, and Cargo Bays.
		Minor changes: Does not appear on extended solar panels that cannot retract. Cargo Bays can be toggled while in motion to whatever they will eventually be.

0.9
		Broke each type into it's own file
		Fixed AYA_SAS code

0.8: 
		Added functionality to the new 1.2 "Science Box."
		"Perform All Science" even though it's not actually a science experiment, for ease of use.
		"Reset All Science" - the good part.
		Will reset all experiments whose data has not been collected.
		Will reset Mystery Goo and Science Jr (and hopefully any modded science) if you have a scientist on board.
		Usage: Pin the Science Box right-click menu, then click in turn "perform science", "collect data", and "reset science." Repeat in all biomes.

0.7: 
		Recompile for KSP 1.2 (Prerelease, should work in final as well)

0.6: 
		Quick fix for M.O.L.E. parts. They utilize ModuleScienceExperiment but shouldn't be auto-collected. I've hard coded to ignore them when triggering science.

0.5: 
		Bugfix release
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA allowed you to run Mystery Goo and Materials Bay science that had been collected, but not reset.

0.4: 
		Bugfix release
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA allowed you to perform surface samples in a command chair without having to upgrade R&D
		Fixed bug in science experiments: AYA would only run the first experiment it came across in any given part. Now it will run each experiment in turn for all parts. Note this did affect the stock game, but would affect any modded parts with multiple experiments.
		Included all source files in source zip, to hopefully make it easier for others to build from source.

0.3: 
		Science Experiments confirmed working.

0.2: 
		Radiators confirmed working.

0.1: 
		Solar panels confirmed working.
