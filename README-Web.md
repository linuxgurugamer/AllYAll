@5thHorseman has passed the maintenance of this mod over to me.  Original thread is here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136173-ksp-1222016-12-13-all-yall-v0101-one-button-common-action-grouping/

 

We've all been there: You slap 48 solar panels on your ship, fly it all the way to Eve, and realize you don't have action groups set up. So you right click all of them and "Extend". Then you come in to Aerobrake, and you have to right click them all again to "Retract". And then once you've landed, sure enough, let's "Extend" them all again.

NO MORE!

Enter All Y'All, the one-stop, one-click extend and retract solution. It is ridiculously simple in implementation. Right click any solar panel (just like you would to extend it) and instead of clicking "Extend" just click "Extend All". Repeat with "Retract All". All Y'All also works with radiators and science, and may expand to other functions in the future.

The following parts are now controlled by this mod:

Antenna
Cargo Bays
Drills
Radiators
SAS
Science Experiments (from a command pod)
Science Experiments (from a Science Box)
Solar Panels
Note: This does not retract non-retractable panels, but the option's still there, and will retract any other panels on the same ship.
